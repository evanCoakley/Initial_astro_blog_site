# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-05-10

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **JUST STARTING THE PROCESS**: I could not decide how to go about building a blog and after pouring over posts and opinions and trying to determine how to best build a blog, I figured I'd better just do it. Then I just happened on this tutorial and figured I'd knock it out. So, with the help of instrumental Rings of Saturn albums and a calming jungle/drum & bass playlist, I should have this knocked out by days end and be well on my way by tomorrow to doing... more ... and more ... and more with my time.

2. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts. I already had a Github account of course but had to sign up for Netlify. This took no time at all.

3. **Making Pages**: I made a few .astro pages, getting familiar with what was already a familiar file structure. 

4. **Making Blog Posts**: Kicked out this blog post. Astro provided this template of course. I just tweaked it a little in terms of content.

## What's next

I'll finish tinkering with this tutorial (which is QUITE helpful, I must say), and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
