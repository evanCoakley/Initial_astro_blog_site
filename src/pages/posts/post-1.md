## What I've accomplished

1. **JUST STARTING THE PROCESS**: I was having trouble deciding how to go about building a blog and after pouring over posts and opinions and trying to determine how to best build a blog, I figured I'd better just do it. Then I just happened on this tutorial and figured I'd knock it out. So, with the help of instrumental Rings of Saturn albums and a calming jungle/drum & bass playlist, I should have this knocked out by days end and be well on my way by tomorrow to doing... more ... and more ... and more with my time.

2. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts. I already had a Github account of course but had to sign up for Netlify. This took no time at all.

3. **Making Pages**: I made a few .astro pages, getting familiar with what was already a familiar file structure. 

4. **Making Blog Posts**: Kicked out this blog post. Astro provided this template of course. I just tweaked it a little in terms of content.

## Random Thoughts
**I've Heard That** it may be a good idea for developers who are attempting to showcase their to use a service like SquareSpace or something of that nature, in order to not spend to much time, frustration and effort, and while I've considered that, I just got sucked into this tutorial last night and after finishing, I think I'll keep working at improving and adding to this project for now. At some point soon I will be posting projects too.

**The tools I used to work on this** last night outside of tech, in terms of keeping focused on getting it done while learning at the same time were:
* 5 cups Black Coffee 
* 1 can of Celsius energy drink at 11pm
* Artist Presha - Sacrifice:Rituals EP (jungle/drum'n'bass) on repeat... for hours.
* 1 Camacho Triple Maduro Gordo cigar

I'm always on the lookout for new and different ways to keep going while working on a computer. Sitting still can be a bit of an obstacle at times, but mindless heavy electronic music, push-ups and/or burpees and whatever stimulant you choose usually does the trick for me. When the concepts I'm learning become quite difficult to wrap my head around, piano sonatas work. Specifically Beethoven or Mozart.


## What's next

I'll continue changing/updating the site, and providing more blog-posts as time goes on. I'm always open to collaborate on other projects. If you have anything important and magnificently insignificant you think I'd like to hear about, feel free to hit me up on LinkedIn.
