        In the future, blog posts will posted here. The subject matter will
        involve code, projects I'm working on, problems I encounter and so

        philosophical renderings that may be seen as brilliant, poorly thought
        out, or just downright insane, along with perhaps a few odd stories from
        the road. It is after a crazy world out there, and I have seen some
        things. I have seen some things...
