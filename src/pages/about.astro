    <h2>...and why this site came to be!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is to be determined but I woke up in a hospital back in 1984 in
      the great and horrifying city of Chicago. My limbs seemed to grow quite a
      bit over the next few years and I found myself and this absolutely
      wonderful woman I was told to call my mother living in Richmond, Va.
      during the early 90s. Eventually I moved to Michigan to live with my
      father in 9th grade, fell back into Chicago for a year and then escaped to
      California where mother had relocated to. And from California and the
      legality of adulthood I couldn't sit still kept waking up hungover in
      different cities across the country until finally I woke up clear headed
      in Nashville, TN in my late twenties, having finally recovered from an
      overpowering psychedelic experience in Austin TX that opened my eyes to
      such incredible possibilities of harmony between humans that as I returned
      to reality I slipped into a crippling depression due to the complete and
      total lack of harmony I saw around me. But a few solid years in Nashville
      seemed to the ole brain some good. I blinked one day and realized that
      without even trying I had married the woman of my dreams, and after a few
      years she screamed a lot one night and then handed me my first child.
      Looking at the lad I realized that after years of jolly excursions into
      the great beyond of purposelessness I finally had so much to stabilize
      myself for and thus I began to pursue a career that didn't cause me to
      emerge from sleep every morning soaked in a paralytic sludge of dread and
      horror. I always figured I'd finally write a book about my reckless
      travels and subsequently drop dead but no. It turns out I have this
      enormous knack for problem solving and a deep love for code.

      So here I am. A software engineer with a passion for web development. I've
      been working in the industry for over 7 years and have experience with a
      wide range of technologies, my absolute favorite for reasons unbeknownst
      to me, being Java with Spring. I suppose I have a subconscious need for
      the stability of Java after a life of utter jolly aimless chaos. I've
      worked on everything from small personal projects to large enterprise
      applications. I'm always looking for new and interesting projects to work
      on, so if you have something you'd like to collaborate on, feel free to
      reach out!

      This here is just me tinkering with Astro, doing the tutorial and seeing
      what I can do with it. I've been considering a blog for a while now so I
      suppose we'll see where this leads... unless there is a tear in the
      time-space continuum and I suddenly find myself dangling from an
      abnormally high telephone pole in an alternate reality where no one
      speaks... which is doubtful, but you never know.

    <p>Here are a few, less scattered facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>
        I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
      </li>
      {
        identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
          <li>
            Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{' '}
            {identity.hobbies[2]}
          </li>
        )
      }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>

    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
